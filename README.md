# Before we start

Before you start, you need to install Python on your machine. 
[Here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) are the instructions. 

Once Python in installed, you need to configure a virtual environment. 
You can find a guide [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)

Finally, you need to install `Jupyter Notebook` 
(see [manual](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/))

Check your installation by executing `jupyter notebook` command in a command shell.
You should see a jupyter notebook running here: `http://localhost:8888/tree`.
A browser window should open automatically once a notebook is launched.
