# Preparing environment

Before you start, you need to install Python on your machine. 
[Here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) are the instructions. 

Once Python in installed, you need to configure a virtual environment. 
You can find a guide [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)

Finally, you need to install `Jupyter Notebook` 
(see [manual](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/))

Check your installation by executing `jupyter notebook` command in a command shell.
You should see a jupyter notebook running here: `http://localhost:8888/tree`.
A browser window should open automatically once a notebook is launched.

# How to submit solutions

For each task create a new branch from `master` called `feature/<test_name>_solution`.

Copy a notebook with the task and call it `<notebook_name> Solutions.ipynb`. Then write your code in this notebook.

For project-like tasks you can write code in simple .py files, not in notebooks, if it's more convenient for you.

Once completed, create a pull-request.
